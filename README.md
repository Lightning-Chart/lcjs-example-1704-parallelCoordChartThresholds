-   Open the project folder in a terminal:

          npm install              # fetches dependencies
          npm start                # builds an application and starts the development server

-   The application is available at _http://localhost:8080_ in your browser, webpack-dev-server provides hot reload functionality.


## Description

A common use case is to display value thresholds on different axes.
E.g. which value range is _bad_ and which is _good_.

This example shows how this can be done by styling the Axis line style with a `PalettedFill`.
